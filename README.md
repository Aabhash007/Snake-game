# Snake game

_This is a simple classic 8 bit snake game created using the canvases of HTML5 and javascript._
I used the design pattern for the code structure. The important thing to know before start is that our snake is formed by a chain of elements (squares) and that the movement is allowed by moving the last square of the snake body to the front of it.

### Istructions:
1. Create the canvas element in our html.
2. Draw the snake’s body and the snake’s food usign canvases.
3. Create the structure of the snake and of the food.
4. Create a _checkCollision_ function to detect if the snake has touched it self.
5. Create the main function which has to run everything we need to play.
6. Use the _keyCode_ event to move the snake using the keyboard.
